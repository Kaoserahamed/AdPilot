# AdPilot

AdPilot is an AI-assisted multi-platform advertising workspace. Give the product one campaign brief, review platform-specific creative, and keep publishing decisions under your control.

## Stack

- Web: React, Vite, TypeScript
- API: FastAPI, Pydantic settings
- Data: PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy architecture (database service is introduced with the backend data feature)
- Jobs: Redis + Celery architecture (worker service is introduced with publishing)
- Integrations: sandbox-first adapters; live Meta and Google clients are opt-in through environment variables

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 20+, Python 3.11+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The web app runs at `http://localhost:5173`. The API foundation is available with:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
pip install -r apps/api/requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir apps/api --reload --port 8000
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before starting services. No secrets are required for the deterministic local experience.

## Repository layout

```text
apps/web       React/Vite frontend
apps/api       FastAPI backend
.github        CI workflows
storage        local development uploads (ignored)
```

## Product implementation sequence

The product follows `PRD.md`: foundation, authentication, campaigns, creatives, AI generation, platform adapters, Meta, Google Ads/YouTube, validation, publishing workers, analytics, AI analysis, hardening, and release validation.

## Authentication

Local authentication uses an HTTP-only session cookie. Passwords are stored as scrypt hashes, session tokens are stored only as SHA-256 hashes, and reset requests use a generic response to avoid account enumeration. The local SQLite database is configured through `AUTH_DB_PATH` and is ignored by Git.

Available endpoints:

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/register
POST /api/v1/auth/login
POST /api/v1/auth/logout
GET  /api/v1/auth/me
POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request
POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm
```


## Live integrations

The local default is sandbox-first. Add approved OAuth credentials and set `LIVE_EXTERNAL_APIS=true` only when Meta and Google developer apps and advertising accounts are available. AdPilot never sends credentials to the browser.
